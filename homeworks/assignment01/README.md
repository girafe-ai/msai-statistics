First home assignment:
* 5 theoretical problems from the [pdf fille](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week01_geometric_probability/MSAI_Probability_Week1_Problem_Set.pdf)
* 2 practical problems in the [ipynb file](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week01_geometric_probability/MSAI_Probability_Week1.ipynb). Second problem is optional, but it is useful to pay attention to it.
