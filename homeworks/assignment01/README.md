First home assignment:
* 5 theoretical problems from the [pdf fille](.../master/week01_geometric_probability/Week01_HW_Theory.pdf)
* 2 practical problems in the [ipynb file](.../master/week01_geometric_probability/Week01_HW_Practice.ipynb). Second problem is optional, but it is useful to pay attention to it.
