Second home assignment:
* 2 theoretical problems from the [pdf fille](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week04_random_vectors/Week04_HW_Theory.pdf)

* Na√Øve Bayes Classifier [practical assignment!](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week02_conditional_probability/MSAI_Probability_Week2_NaiveBayes_HW.ipynb). If you need to refresh your memories, here's the [notebook from the seminar](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week02_conditional_probability/MSAI_Probability_Week2_NaiveBayes_Seminar.ipynb). The .csv file with the data is [here](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week02_conditional_probability/NaiveBayes_HW_data.csv)

* Just read [this material](https://github.com/girafe-ai/msai-statistics/blob/main/week03_distributions/MSAI_Probability_Week3_MultivariateNormal.ipynb) about the Multivariate Normal distribution.
